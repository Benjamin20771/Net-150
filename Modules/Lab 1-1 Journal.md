### Lab explanation:

In this lab, we used a Windows 10 VM without firewall protection to look at Network Connectivity and look at different IP addresses and show differences between different areas 

### Command Prompts 
-ipconfig = This is used to look at your computers IPV4 Address and other useful network information

-ipconfig/all = This shows the same as ipconfig but shows more including your DNS servers and your physical address

-ping = This is a useful command where it tests the network devices' reachability

-tracert = running this command with something like "www.google.com" will report each router encountered between your device and Google.

-nslookup =
