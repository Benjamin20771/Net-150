# Lab 3-2

### Summary
In this lab me and a partner pinged each others addresses to analyze the mac addresses if they were differnt or not. This lab also showed if a IP is not on the same network then the MAC address will be unavailable.

### Commands
- Ping = The ability to "ping" another IP address

### Troubleshooting
Me and my partner had accidently pinged each other and we needed to erase the data so we were able to use arp -d from the last lab to help out.

### Other information
You can capture a packet by lets say you ping an IP, you can do search in wireshark for that IP reply and response and look at the information within the packet.

ARP is Address Resolution Protocol and it translates IP addresses to MAC addresses
