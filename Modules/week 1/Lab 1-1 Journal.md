# Lab Journal

### Lab explanation:

In this lab, we used a Windows 10 VM without firewall protection to look at Network Connectivity and look at different IP addresses and show differences between different areas 

### Command Prompts 
-ipconfig = This is used to look at your computers IPV4 Address and other useful network information

-ipconfig/all = This shows the same as ipconfig but shows more including your DNS servers and your physical address

-ping = This is a useful command where it tests the network devices' reachability

-tracert = running this command with something like "www.google.com" will report each router encountered between your device and Google.

-nslookup = This command will leave you with the ability to look up Domain Name Systems (DNS) and will first leave you with a ">". You can then look up any server or device to find the IP addresses

### Problems with lab

- The only problem I ran into in this lab was first trying to figure out GitHub but I had a friend explain it to me. I also had a problem with the firewall portion because it wouldn't turn off at first but when I reset the system it allowed me to turn it off.

### Other Useful Notes

-I found it interesting to see that I could find out my neighbor's IP by just raising the last number of my IP by one because he was the device to my right so I assume if I had gone left it would've decreased by one.
