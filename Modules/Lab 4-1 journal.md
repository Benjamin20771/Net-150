# Lab 4-1

### Summary
This lab was to experiment with making a small network to observe ARP. It consisted of one switch and four PCs. It helped me get used to how Cisco packet tracer works and familiarize myself with my tools. We then looked into the Mac addresses and assigned IP Addresses to the PCs which allowed me to ping other PCs after connecting them all to the switch. We were then able to look at the ports and mac addresses by looking at the switch.
