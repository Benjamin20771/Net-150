# Lab 4-1

### Summary
This lab was to experiment with making a small network to observe ARP. It consisted of one switch and four PCs. It helped me learn how Cisco packet tracer works and familiarize myself with my tools. We then looked into the Mac addresses and assigned IP Addresses to the PCs which allowed me to ping other PCs after connecting them all to the switch. We could then look at the ports and Mac addresses by looking at the switch.

### Commands

arp -a = This is used to see if there are any arp entries on the system yet

enable = goes to admin mode on CLI

show mac-address-table = self-explanatory but shows the mac addresses connected to the switch

ping = should already know this but it 'pings' another PC
