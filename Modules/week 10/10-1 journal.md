# Lab 10-1

### Summary
In this lab, we were given a file to download and it was three networks where we wanted to set up the RIP (v2) on the routers. With this, we put commands into CLI(see below) and connected the routers. We then turned on simulation mode to see RIPv2 packets from different routers to see what it was doing. 

### Commands 

enable-allows commands into CLI

config terminal- allows the access to edit the terminal

router rip- allows access to the RIP section of the terminal

version 2- Makes rip version 2

network x.x.x.x-This adds a network address to the rip of the router

Note-RIP doesn't need a subnet cuz it automatically steals it from the router itself
