# Lab 6-2

### Summary of Classful Subnetting
This lab was interesting for me because I struggled with it a decent amount. We made three separate networks and connected them all. The photo below helped out a lot as it explained what to use the IPs for. 

### Commands

Not many commands unless you wanted to use the GUI area to fill in information.

Tip-You can see how to do commands when you fill out the information manually on the bottom

### Troubleshooting

### Other Information

The router IP has to be the default gateway of the PCs connected to that router. 

You must have an RIP involved when connecting routers to tell each other what network to look for.
