# Lab 5-1

### Summary
We started the lab by making a network with 5 PCs, one router, and one switch, and later, we added a sniffer and replaced the switch with a hub for data collection. Using IPs like 192.168.X.X with subnets of 255.255.255.0 and Gateways relating to the IPs like 192.168.X.X to keep everything the same. PCs on the same switch must have the same default gateway. Then when we use the sniffer it can identify the packets going to and from HELLO! to PING ME! and we can see data switch up depending on if we're using a hub or switch.
