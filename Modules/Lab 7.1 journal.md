# Lab 7.1

### Summary

This lab was two routers(1 N.A. and 1 Mumbai). The N.A router had three switches with 2 devices on each while the Mumbai router had 2 switches with 2 devices on each. I then had to put IPs, subnets, and default gateways into the devices. The table below explains all the numbers. Again the router IP has to be the same as the device default gateway. The subnet must also be the same for the connected parts. The serial connections are going to be the last row on the table same as IPs with +1. You would use the 113 and 114. It's not very difficult but If I need a reminder please go to the Cisco packet tracer and refer to the lab. Please also refer to the subnetting tips if having problems with CIDR.

### Commands

Router rip = putting the CLI to rip

version 2 = makes rip version 2

### Troubleshooting

I had little to no problems with this lab and I understood it amazingly well and it helped me understand subnetting better. 

One problem I ran into was connecting the switches to the router as I just mixed the connections up. All I had to do was reconnect the cord to the correct Giga ethernet on the router.
