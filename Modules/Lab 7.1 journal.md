# Lab 7.1

### Summary

This lab was two routers(1 N.A. and 1 Mumbai). The N.A router had three switches with 2 devices on each while the Mumbai router had 2 switches with 2 devices on each. 

### Commands

Router rip = putting the CLI to rip

version 2 = makes rip version 2

### Troubleshooting

I had little to no problems with this lab and I understood it amazingly well and it helped me understand subnetting better. 

One problem I ran into was connecting the switches to the router as I just mixed the connections up. All I had to do was reconnect the cord to the correct Giga ethernet on the router.
