# Lab 4-2

### Summary
In this lab, we again used packet tracer but opened a file that can be accessed on the top of the screen of packet tracer which gave us a network with three PCs and a multilayer Switch. We then put IP and Subnet masks into the PCs(like in the past lab) and then did the same to the ethernets 1-3. We then opened the simulation tab at the bottom which we filtered to show ICMP only. Finally, when pinging the PCs we could see the simulation happening and we were able to look into the details of every movement of the packet.

### Commands 
No commands other than 'ping' which we know (look at past lab journals)

### Troubleshooting 
I wasn't sure where the start button was in the simulation so I just goofed around for a while and eventually found it cuz the worst that could happen was I had to restart.

### Extra Information
config- In PCs and switches this holds the area we go to for IPs, Default Gateways, and Subnet Masks

        ----You can set different IPs/subnet masks for each ethernet under the interface tab in config

You can enter simulation mode in packet tracer at the bottom of the screen to the right labeled "Simulation"

You can then filter the simulation by clicking the 'edit filters' button and clicking on what you want like 'ICMP'
