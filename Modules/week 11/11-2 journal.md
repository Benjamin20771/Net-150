# Lab 11-2 VLANs/ROAS

### Summary
In this lab, we had to use the 11-1 lab and make sure ALL PCs could ping each other. First, we had to put the VLANs on the router and connect it to a switch(make sure trunk is used). Then, there was an error in the lab where we put in commands to fix it, as VLAN 10 had an error on it. (See the screenshot for more info.) Then, everything was able to ping each other.

### Troubleshooting
The only thing I ran into was a problem with was I used the gigabit ethernet to connect switches, so I had to use the second one to connect to the router instead of the first one.
